# Photo Store Demo
The Photo Store demo is an end to end rich-client application that uses several different features of the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The user interface (UI) takes advantage of many styling techniques in order to create a visually attractive and interesting UI. Subtle animation effects are used to enhance the user experience, and draw attention to specific UI elements. Photo editing support is included, demonstrating the ability to rotate, crop, or turn an image to black and white. Multi-level undo of photo operations is also supported.
