# Editing Examiner Demo
Editing Examiner lets you watch in real time as edits are performed within a RichTextBox control. It allows the user to load or partially insert Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) into a document by using the core parser or the editing parser. In addition, it provides basic support for invoking methods, as well as getting and setting properties. This tool is useful for examining the editing status of a document from different perspectives.
