# Local Animations Sample
This sample shows how to use local, or non-storyboard, animations. Non-storyboard animations are only available in code. To create an animation in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), use a storyboard. For an example that shows how to use storyboards to animate properties, see the Property Animation Sample.
