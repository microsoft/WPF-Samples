# Hit Test with Win32 Interoperation Sample
This sample illustrates how to use the default hit testing support in the visual layer of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Hit testing is performed by using the HitTest method of the VisualTreeHelper class to determine whether a point coordinate value is within the boundary of a given object. The sample also uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) interop support to create a host Win32 window for the visual objects.
