# Create a Data Object from a Text Selection Sample
This sample creates a data object from a text selection.
The user is able to use the mouse to select provided sample text in a TextBox, and then click a button to create a data object that contains the text selection. One of the DataObject constructors is used to create the data object and specify the contained data and corresponding data format. The DataFormats class provides a static type string that is used to specify the data format as "Text". Finally, the sample displays the native data formats and corresponding data stored in the newly-created data object.
