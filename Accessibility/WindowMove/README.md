# WindowPattern Sample
This sample demonstrates how to use the WindowPattern control pattern to control the screen location of a top-level window as well as register and listen for standard window events.

This sample defines two applications; an instance of Notepad used as a UI Automation provider, or target application, and a UI Automation client that operates against this target application.
