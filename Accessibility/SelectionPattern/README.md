# SelectionPattern and SelectionItemPattern Sample
This sample demonstrates the Microsoft UI Automation SelectionPattern and SelectionItemPattern control pattern classes.

The sample consists of a Windows Forms target and a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) client. The client uses the SelectionPattern and SelectionItemPattern control patterns to interact with the collection of controls in the target. The functionality demonstrated by the sample includes the dynamic construction of selection controls in the client that map to the controls found in the target, a report of important properties for each selection control, and the ability to echo selection events from the target in the client and vice versa.
