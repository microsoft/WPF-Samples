# TextPattern Search and Selection Sample
This sample demonstrates the Microsoft UI Automation TextPattern and TextPatternRange classes.

The sample consists of a WPF client and the choice of a FlowDocumentReader (Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)) target or a WordPad (Win32) target. The client uses the TextPattern control pattern class and the TextPatternRange class to interact with the text controls in the target.

The functionality demonstrated by the sample includes the ability to search for and select a string of text within the target, manipulate the existing selections within the target by expanding or contracting them to a specific TextUnit, and navigate forward or backward within the text of the target.

## Remarks
Three WPF documents are provided in the Content folder of the TextProvider project.
