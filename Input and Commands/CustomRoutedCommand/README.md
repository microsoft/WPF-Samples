# Create a Custom RoutedCommand Sample
This sample shows how to create and use a custom RoutedCommand. It demonstrates how to create the RoutedCommand in code behind, create a CommandBinding, the Executed and CanExecute event handlers, and how to hook up the commands up in XAML.

The custom RoutedCommand toggles the background color of a StackPanel.
