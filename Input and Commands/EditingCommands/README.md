# EditingCommands Sample
This sample demonstrates the commands provided by the EditingCommands class.

The sample provides buttons to invoke each editing command; each button is labeled with the corresponding default key gesture for the command. The sample provides three editing controls with sample content: RichTextBox, TextBox, and PasswordBox; the user may select which of these controls the editing commands are routed to.

Use this sample to invoke editing commands on the different Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) editing controls, and to observe the resulting effects and behaviors.
