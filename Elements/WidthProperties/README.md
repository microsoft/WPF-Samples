# Width Properties Comparison Sample
This sample shows the differences among the width-related properties in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The sample exposes four properties on FrameworkElement that describe the width characteristics of an element. These values can conflict and when they do, the MinWidth value takes precedence over the MaxWidth value, which in turn takes precedence over the Width value.

## Build the sample
The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/wpf-vs).

### Deploying the sample
