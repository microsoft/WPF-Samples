# Width Properties Comparison Sample
This sample shows the differences among the width-related properties in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The sample exposes four properties on FrameworkElement that describe the width characteristics of an element. These values can conflict and when they do, the MinWidth value takes precedence over the MaxWidth value, which in turn takes precedence over the Width value.
