# Height Properties Sample
This sample shows the differences among the height-related properties in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The sample demonstrates the effects of three properties declared by FrameworkElement that describe the height characteristics of an element. These values can conflict and when they do, the MinHeight value takes precedence over the MaxHeight value, which in turn takes precedence over the Height value.

## Build the sample
The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/wpf-vs).
