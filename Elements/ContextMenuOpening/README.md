# ContextMenuOpening Handlers Sample
This example illustrates some handling techniques for the ContextMenuOpening event. This event is useful for adjusting or replacing the context menu just prior to display in the user interface (UI).
Replacing the context menu does have some timing issues that you should be aware of. For more information, see the task topic that is intended as a companion topic for this sample, [How to: Handle the ContextMenuOpening Event](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb625936.aspx).
