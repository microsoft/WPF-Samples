# WPF Controls Gallery Sample
This sample graphically shows common usage scenarios and the default rendering behavior for many user interface (UI) and layout controls in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The Controls Gallery features a collapsible table of contents that has entries for many of the UI and layout controls that are supported in WPF. When you compile the sample, you can easily navigate the gallery and experience for yourself the breadth of the development platform
