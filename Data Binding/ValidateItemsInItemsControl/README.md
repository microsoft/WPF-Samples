# Validate an Item in an ItemsControl Sample
This sample validates items in an ItemsControl by using the ItemsControl.ItemBindingGroup property. A BindingGroup contains multiple Binding objects and ValidationRule objects. When a ValidationRule that belongs to a BindingGroup runs, the Validate method can get the value of each binding in the BindingGroup. When the BindingExpressions is set to the ItemsControl.ItemBindingGroup property, each item container gets a BindingGroup that has the same ValidationRule objects as the ItemsControl.ItemBindingGroup, but the properties that describe the data in the bindings, such as Items and BindingExpressions, are specific to the data for each item in the ItemsControl.
