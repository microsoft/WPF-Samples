# Validate the Data of an Object Sample
This sample demonstrates how to validate multiple bindings against each other by using a BindingGroup. A BindingGroup contains multiple Binding objects and ValidationRule objects. When a ValidationRule that belongs to a BindingGroup runs, the Validate method can get the value of each binding in the BindingGroup.
