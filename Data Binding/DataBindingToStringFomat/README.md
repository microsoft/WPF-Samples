# Formatting a String on a Binding Sample
This sample formats bound data by using the StringFormat property on a Binding and a MultiBinding. The sample binds a ListView to a collection of items for sale and uses the StringFormat on the Binding for the price to format the value as a currency. The sample also binds a ListBox to the collection and uses StringFormat on a MultiBinding to display a string that includes the description and price for each item.
