# Merged ResourceDictionary Sample
This example illustrates the merged-dictionary capabilities of ResourceDictionary. A merged dictionary can be used to incorporate a resource dictionary that comes from a separate file (typically this is a noncompiled XAML file that is included in the application, and referenced by pack URI). To see some of this behavior yourself by modifying this sample, try introducing deliberate identical key names into the base dictionary, or either of the two merged dictionaries.

## Build the sample
The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the [repo](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples?tab=readme-ov-file) page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the samples in [Visual Studio 2022](https://www.visualstudio.com/wpf-vs).
